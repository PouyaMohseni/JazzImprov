# Genetic Algorithm for Jazz Improvisation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and findings of a project focused on generating jazz solos using a genetic algorithm. The project explores existing genetic algorithms for jazz improvisation, introduces enhancements, and proposes a novel fitness function based on anomaly detection through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). The goal is to advance the genetic algorithms used for jazz improvisation generation.
